## Description

Music Controls is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily control your favorite
music players from within Neovim. The plugin basically acts as a wrapper around
`playerctl`, a command-line utility that can control media players.
This makes almost any music player compatible with Music Controls, ranging from
Spotify to VLC, etc.

I created Music Controls to make it more convenient and efficient to control my
music player while working within Neovim. Instead of constantly switching workspaces
or opening a terminal to control my music player, I can use this plugin to do it
all within Neovim. You might say that I'm lazy, some say I'm not ðŸ˜‰!

I hope that others who have similar needs will find Music Controls useful as well.

## Installation

This example uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to install/load
the plugin. Other plugin managers can be used as well.

```lua
{
  'AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim',
  dependencies = { 'rcarriga/nvim-notify' }
}
```

### Dependencies

Music Controls requires `playerctl`  to be installed in order to work properly.

## Configuration

Optionally, you can specify a default music player by adding the following code
to your `init.lua` file:

```lua
{
  'AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim',
  dependencies = { 'rcarriga/nvim-notify' },
  opts = {
    default_player = 'spotify'
  }
}
```

The example above sets Spotify as the default music player.
If you don't specify a default player, Music Controls requires you to specify a player.
Refer to the [commands](#commands) section for more information.
