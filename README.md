## Description

Music Controls is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily control your favorite music players from within Neovim.
The plugin uses `playerctl` to control the music players, so it is required that `playerctl` is installed on your system in order to use the plugin.
Additionally, the music players you want to control (such as Spotify, VLC, etc.) must also be installed on your system.

I created Music Controls to make it more convenient and efficient to control my music player while working within Neovim.
Instead of constantly switching workspaces or opening a terminal to control my music player, I can use this plugin to do it all within Neovim.
You might say that I'm lazy, some say I'm not ðŸ˜‰!
I hope that others who have similar needs will find Music Controls useful as well.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Music Controls requires `playerctl` and of corse Spotify to be installed in order to work properly.

### Using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

1. Add this to your Neovim config:

```lua
use {
    'AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim',
    requires = {
        'rcarriga/nvim-notify'
    }
}

```

2. Run `:PackerSync` to install the plugin on your machine.

### Using [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

1. Add the following to your Neovim config:

```vim
Plug 'rcarriga/nvim-notify'
Plug 'AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim'
```

2. Run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin on your machine.

### Manually

1. Clone this repository into your Neovim ~/.config/nvim/pack/plugins/start/directory.
2. Clone the `nvim-notify` repository into you Neovim ~/.config/nvim/pack/plugins/start/directory.

### Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you can use the following commands followed by the player of your choice from within Neovim.

-   `:MusicPlay` - Play the current track.
-   `:MusicPause` - Pause the current track.
-   `:MusicNext` - Skip to the next track.
-   `:MusicPrev` - Go back to the previous track.
-   `:MusicCurrent` - Display the current track.
-   `:MusicListPlayers` - List all players available to control.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the commands mentioned above:

```
:MusicPlay spotify          # Toggle play.
:MusicNext spotify          # Skip to the next track.
:MusicPrev spotify 4        # Skip the 4 next tracks.
:MusicPause spotfy          # Pause the current track.
:MusicListPlayers           # List out all players available.
```

#### Specifying a Default Player

You can specify a default music player by adding the following code to your `init.lua` file:

```lua
_G.music_controls_default_player = 'spotify'
```

This will set Spotify as the default music player for Music Controls. You can substitute `spotify` with the name of any other music player you want to set as the default.

With a default player set, you can use Music Controls commands without specifying a player each time.
For example, `:MusicPlay` will automatically use the default player instead of requiring you to enter `:MusicPlay spotify`.
After setting a default player, you can still control all other players by specifying it as the argument.

For more information, refer to the documentation by typing `:h MusicControls`.
