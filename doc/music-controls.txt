2. Configuration                                  *MusicControlsConfiguration*

    Music Controls doesn't really need any configuration, the only thing
    that can be configured is the default player.

Default player                                    *MusicControlsDefaultPlayer*

    You can specify a default music player by adding the following code to
    your `init.lua` file:

>
    _G.music_controls_default_player = 'spotify'
<

    Or your in case you are using a `init.vim` file:

>
    g.muic_controls_default_player = 'spotify'
<

    This will set Spotify as the default music player for Music Controls.
    You can substitute `spotify` with the name of any other music player
    you want to set as the default.

    With a default player set, you can use Music Controls commands without
    specifying a player each time.
    For example, `:MusicPlay` will automatically use the default player
    instead of requiring you to enter `:MusicPlay spotify`.
