2. Configuration                                  *MusicControlsConfiguration*

    Music Controls doesn't really need any configuration, the only thing
    that can be configured is the default player.

Default player                                    *MusicControlsDefaultPlayer*

    A default player can be configured by calling the `setup` function and
    passing the name of the player to the `default_player` key.

    For example, lazy.nvim users can add the following code to their
    `init.lua` file:
>
    {
      'AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim',
      dependencies = { 'rcarriga/nvim-notify' },
      opts = {
        default_player = 'spotify'
      }
    }
<
    This will set Spotify as the default music player for Music Controls.
    You can substitute `spotify` with the name of any other music player
    you want to set as the default.

    With a default player set, you can use Music Controls commands without
    specifying a player each time.
    For example, `:MusicPlay` will automatically use the default player
    instead of requiring you to enter `:MusicPlay spotify`.
